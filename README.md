# Text Holder

Text Holder is a simple web application that allows users to quickly type or paste text and images. It is especially convenient when people want to save something temporarily but donâ€™t want to open a new file. The content is saved locally in the user's browser, making it easy to retrieve even after refreshing the page.

## Live Demo

Check out the live application deployed on AWS Amplify:

## Features (to be continued...)

- **Content Persistence**: Content is saved in the browser's local storage, so it persists between sessions unless the browser cache is cleared.
- **Image Pasting**: Paste images directly into the content area.
- **Resizable Images**: Inserted images can be resized interactively by clicking and dragging.
